I'm known for balancing the\n      tradeoff between meticulous code and rapid prototyping, in order to get\n      products into customers hands for testing as part of the product\n      development process.\n    </Para>\n    <Para>\n      I’m as passionate about building / influencing the best solution as I am\n      about being approachable and using my experiences and research skills to\n      help others. As well as seeking out mentoring opportunities in the wider\n      business, I always take the opportunity to help others understand the\n      value of the technical decisions we make and what they bring to the\n      business. Just as important is bridging the gap between the product team\n      and senior members of a client's business, in order to secure trust and\n      confidence in the development partnership. My strategic approach has often\n      resulted in clients both extending existing projects, and returning for\n      further future project work.\n    </Para>\n    <Para>\n      The most recent client projects I've worked on have suited a React / React\n      Native, Typescript & GraphQL based solution, but previously I've worked on\n      a more conventional production stack based on Ruby on Rails and Phoenix /\n      Elixir. The build pipeline has normally consisted of a CI build process on\n      CircleCI, GitHub Actions, CodeShip or Jenkins with the infrastructure\n      being managed in terraform and deployed to a client's aws or heroku\n      account. I've also built React Native mobile apps, which were released to\n      the App Store and Google Play through fastlane and Visual Studio App\n      Center.\n    </Para>\n    <Para>\n      Throughout my career I've built up a wide range of expertise and depth of\n      knowledge in the entire product development process. Whether it be\n      responding to RFPs; rapid prototyping; user testing; building production\n      ready code; working with in-house qa engineers; or managing a project\n      handover; I’ve always been eager to learn more.\n    </Para>\n    <Para>I'm looking for work, get in touch.</Para>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n"],"names":["Para","LargePara","location"],"sourceRoot":""}
